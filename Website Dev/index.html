<!--	how to use
		there are two types of backgrounds,
		200 height paper and 100 height paper.
		when you insert more infomation, 
		look at infomation load and choose 
		what you would like to use for paper size.
		
		CAUTION!
		do not go over 800 pixels (4, 200 height paperback.jpg images, at full screen mode)
		due to background looping, that can not be helped because it is wood.
		we can't fix wood looping, because they have specific patterns.
		I'm sure you won't though.

					computer scientist to work out, only to go back to manual book keeping, 
					or perhaps it was so complicated you didn't even get started.<br/><br/>
					TradieTrakka is SIMPLE, EASY, and SAVES YOU TIME.<br/>
Take care of Quotes, Invoices, Expenses and GST, all in a few, easy clicks.
